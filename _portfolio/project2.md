* In our experiment, participants will engage in a 3DoF Charade game within a virtual environment. The game will involve two participants: one will act out the words, and the other will guess. The game will be timed, and the goal is to guess as many words as possible within the time limit. This visually-driven task will help us assess communication and engagement in a VR setting.
