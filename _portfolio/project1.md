* The user experience will be evaluated using a mix of questionnaires and performance tracking. Before the experiment, participants will fill out a questionnaire that collects basic information and assesses their initial feelings, including any predisposition to motion sickness. 
* After the experiment, participants will complete another questionnaire to see whether the VR session caused any discomfort. 
* We will also be tracking performance during a VR charade game.
