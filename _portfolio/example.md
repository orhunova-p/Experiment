* An HMD-based experiment is a research conducted using a Head-Mounted Display (HMD), that provides immersive virtual reality (VR) experiences. These experiments typically involve participants interacting with a simulated environment through the HMD, allowing researchers to study behavior, perception, and cognitive responses in a controlled, immersive setting. 
* An HMD is a device worn on the head, like a pair of goggles, that displays 3D images and tracks your head movements, making you feel as if you are inside the virtual world. In this experiment, participants will wear the Oculus 2 to interact with a simulated environment, allowing us to study how people behave and respond in VR settings.
